			<h1>The Unnamed Yellow</h1>
			<article>
			I like yellow, and I truly do. Perhaps one that is less direct. Perhaps one that is generated by the street light that vanishes in day but lives at night. Last spring, I passed by a huge tree with lush foliage in Upper West Side, New York. I knew it was green, a variety of different green and even a little bit of white, but primarily green. However, when I walked by it at night, it turned out to be convoluted. It was an indescribable kind of yellow, too hard to say if it was a yellow-ish green or a green-ish yellow, or perhaps both. It felt that the colors were carefully planned and mixed, applied and erased, covered and remixed between the lights and the tree. It was delicate and specific, in a natural way, that even a little breeze would break the combination and balance. I wanted to take a picture of the color on my phone, but how hilarious, the yellow light turned to be a gigantic flare in camera that was not even yellow. It was more of white, as if a white paint unconsciously dropped on a rough, grainy canvas and by accident, covered the most of it. And when I looked further, the white wall of a nearby building also seemed to be a warm, yellow-ish one. I even questioned whether the yellow-ishness inherently existed in the material or was a pure reflection, but it was never easy to tell. And again, all the yellow lights tuned into white paint in the camera. Drip, drip, drip.<br/>

			I realized that it was the color that could not be captured but only to be perceived. But how do I know if my perception is the same as yours? Perhaps the radiance and reflection of yellow light is not a color but an idea of color. One that is so dependent on individual’s perception yet has the power to turn everything into a wide variety and richness of yellow. Indeed, it is a world of yellow, like the world of color we live in day or the world of black-and-white we sketch.<br/>

			Now I say yellow, for there is a transient moment that the world is not pursuing differences but finds similarities, for some time in a day that everything is not bustling and competing, but silently merging into an inseparable whole.<br/>

			In it I feel true peace and joy, even just for a moment, even it is unnamed, nor recordable.

			<h1>黃，無以名狀</h1>
			<section>
				我鍾愛著黃。或許不是亮眼螫人的那種，或許是路燈的黃，在白晝時消亡卻於夜裡綻放。去年春天，我在紐約上西城，打一棵鬱鬱蔥蔥的樹邊走過；我瞧見它繁茂的綠，深深淺淺，彷若少女的秀髮那般清亮，卻憂愁地撒著幾綹白絲。當我於暮色中再次經過，年少與白頭，在日月錯落之際溶成一片。是黃中帶綠抑或綠中夾黃，我想那大概屬於青黃不接的彼刻，乾澀地無以名狀；彷彿是光和樹，勉強卻細心湊和著調和，才成就了一番微風無法驚擾、黃澄澄的風景。我想過拍照，將這樣的黃記載於我的書箋。可那黃卻極盡狂傲地訕笑，在鏡頭的水眸中，散成一波波的白；像帆布沾上的漆，終究存成了粗糙的像素點。當我凝視遠方，記憶中那片皎白的牆，卻霎時令我感到溫煦。我疑惑著黃是否早已存在，或僅僅是印象的投射，但我從來就難以分辨。於是黃光再一次笑成了白暈，滴答，滴答。<br/>

				那時候我便明白，顏色只待感知，而無從攫取。我該如何知道這樣的黃普世皆然，抑或僅為一種懷想。在我的意識裡，黃深深淺淺，像極了那棵佝僂的少女樹；人間多彩與素描的黑白，都遁入了同一種俗氣。<br/>

				因為黃，這世界掙得了一個安詳的時節，不再爭異而是求同；紐約的喧囂謝了幕，人與樹活成一片濃稠光影。於是我衷心感到平靜和自由，在無以名狀的黃裡。<br/>
