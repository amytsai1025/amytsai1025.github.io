			<h2>The Analysis of <i><a href="https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/463786" target="_blank">Mourning Virgin from a Crucifixion Group</a></i></h2>
			<article>
				<section>
				Created around mid- to late-15th century A.D., <i>Mourning Virgin from a Crucifixion Group</i> is a French sculpture made of walnut with traces of paint, currently on display at The Metropolitan Museum of Art. While its title suggests the act of “mourning”, the sculptor barely presents the figure’s sorrow through direct signs, such as facial expression or tears. Instead, the sculptor creates a solemn, quiet and almost unapproachable atmosphere with the figure’s pose as well as the use of shadow and visual weight. In the absence of the direct clues associated with mourning, these rather subtle representations help internalize the figure’s agony and convey an even stronger and more repressive emotional suffering.
				</section>
				<section>
				One of the most noticeable features of the sculpture is that about half of the figure’s face is covered by the shadow of cloth, which automatically generates a sense of distance between the sculpture and the viewer. No matter how close the viewer is to the sculpture, or the different angles he or she approaches, it is almost impossible to have any eye contact with the figure, let alone feeling emotions from its eyes. From an extreme close-up photo of the figure’s face, one can find out that the boundary of the veil’s shadow cuts exactly through the lower edge of the eyes. Quite possibly, the exactness may not be coincidence, but the sculptor’s deliberate intention to not show the figure’s eyes to the viewer. In addition, for the remaining facial parts that are visible, there is barely, if any, detail that can align with “mourning”. Instead, the expression seems fairly emotionally detached with the closed lips—no crying or wailing, almost too calm to convey any feelings. However, if the viewer looks at the sculpture as a whole, there is little doubt that the figure is immersed in sadness or undergoing a distressing moment. The question is: Where does this sorrow come from?
				</section>
				<section>
				Quite different from the common approach to depict emotional pain, the sculptor shifts the viewers’ attention from the figure’s face to its lower body, where we focus on the hands and the clothing folds, with disruptive lines. What is interesting is that the entire sculpture is mostly created in vertical lines, including the outline of the veil, the standing pose of the figure, and the clothing folds—except for the folds in the middle, which go in horizontal zigzag lines. Compared to other smooth lines, these abrupt, zigzag lines generate a rough, uneasy feeling that echoes with the figure’s sorrow and complicated emotion.

				Moreover, these folds also create layers with an important element of this sculpture—the shadow, by allowing space between two folds. While this sculpture is made of brown walnut lumber, which has relatively few color variations, the use of shadow helps construct a wider range of colors—from light brown to dark black—as well as the dramatic contrast between light and darkness. In addition to building up a stronger sense of depth and a three-dimensional perspective, the shadow also possesses functional value that influences the sculpture’s compositional structure, such as hindering the visibility of the figure’s gaze, as mentioned in the second paragraph, that adds on the remoteness and inaccessibility of the figure.
				</section>
				<section>
				Besides shadow, the sculptor also uses the folds’ exaggeratedly large sizes and thickness to establish visual weight, which generates physical and emotional heaviness. Distinct from the common conception of fabrics as soft and lightweight, the sculptor intentionally makes the clothing folds at the figure’s lower body way thicker than its upper part. On the one hand, it further emphasizes the lower body’s heaviness, which again, aids to direct the viewers’ focuses. On the other hand, this heaviness also creates a sinking force that drags the viewers’ hearts downwards. The disproportionally large folds serve similar purpose. By adding visual weight to the lower part of the sculpture, the sculptor establishes a depressing mood reinforcing the figure’s gloominess and sorrow.
				</section>
				<section>
				Instead of revealing the sadness of the figure through evident hints, the sculptor takes a unique approach by dramatizing and distorting the inanimate elements—such as shadows and clothing folds—to shape the center of attention and impact visual weight. The effects of these inanimate things play a vital role by conveying the deep mourning and creating a distressing atmosphere. This observation, however, is not to ignore the sculptor’s attempt to imply complex emotions on lively objects as well. For instance, among the very few body parts revealed, the figure’s left hand appears to be tense that shows its nervousness while the right hand seems to soothe and repress it to stay calm, which also represents the contradiction between the figure’s inner sadness and its calm pose. Yet most importantly, the sculptor does empower the originally neutral elements to carry intense emotions, therefore drastically manipulate and impact the viewers’ perceptions and feelings of the sculpture.

				《耶穌行刑的哀悼聖女》（暫譯）為一尊胡桃雕像，約於15世紀下半葉創作而成，目前展覽於紐約大都會博物館。儘管旨在表達「哀悼」，這位雕刻家（佚名）卻不以表情傳遞傷感，而是藉由聖女的姿勢、雕像的光影和視覺重量，堆砌出莊嚴、不可親近的氛圍。比起直接的表達，這些細微的線索更內化了聖女的痛苦，對觀者深入傳達其悲慟之情。
				</section>
				<section>
				這尊雕像大約一半的臉部皆被頭紗的陰影遮蔽，使觀者與雕像之間產生距離感。不論觀者如何靠近，抑或轉向不同角度，皆無法與聖女的視線有所接觸，更遑論從其眼中感受到情緒。若仔細看這尊雕像，則會發現頭紗陰影的下緣正好蓋過聖女的眼眸；這很可能不是出於巧合，而是雕刻家精心安排，不願讓聖女與觀眾對視。除此之外，在沒有被陰影覆蓋的下半張臉，觀者幾乎無法從任何細節感受到「哀悼」。聖女的雙唇緊抿，看似冷靜安詳，似乎不帶一絲情緒；然而，觀者卻能輕易從這尊雕像感受到其悲苦。這樣的情緒究竟是從何而來呢？
				</section>
				<section>
				若將視線由臉部往下移一些，我們會看到雕像的手及其衣物的皺褶。值得一提的是，儘管這個雕像的結構大多為垂直線組成（如：直立的身體、頭紗的線條等），這些裙擺中間的皺褶卻呈現近乎水平的鋸齒狀。和其他平順的垂直線相比，這些不規則的水平線傳達了一種狂放、不安之感，似乎能與聖女內心悲傷的激動情緒相應和。
				</section>
				<section>
				這些水平的皺褶同時帶出了一項雕塑的重要元素——陰影。儘管這尊雕像整體胡桃木的顏色相近，陰影的使用讓其有了強烈的明暗對比，以及從淺褐到深黑的顏色差異。這不僅使這尊雕像更加立體，也影響了——如前述所提，觀者與雕像的對視關係——進而營造雕像的肅穆之情與距離感。

				在陰影之外，雕刻家也用裙擺皺褶大小和厚度的誇飾，來建立這尊雕像的視覺重量，疊加於視覺觀感和觀者的情緒之上，而產生沈重感。一般而言，雕刻家善於將布料刻的輕薄柔軟，但這位雕刻家卻刻意在視覺上，使聖女的下半身明顯重於上半身。一方面，這樣的視覺重量有助於引導觀者的視線向下；另一方面，它也創造了一種下沉的力量，彷彿使觀者的心跟著下墜。而衣襬皺折的放大也同樣強化了聖女沮喪、沈重的幽黯心情。
				</section>
				<section>
				當然，這並不代表雕刻家僅將情緒傳達附加於「無機物」之上，例如聖女的左手感覺十分緊繃，而右手似乎試圖舒緩、壓抑其激動的情緒。這亦對比了聖女心中的悲慟和其冷靜的外在形象。整體而言，這位雕刻家以獨特的手法，將平凡靜物——如皺褶和陰影——誇張、變形化，藉此主導觀者的注意力和影響視覺重量，緊扣著這尊雕像的中心主題「哀悼」，使情緒迴盪於觀者心中。
