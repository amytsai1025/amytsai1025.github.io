		<h1>Reading Visuals</h1>
		<p>
			I hope to write about how to "close read" a picture and/or artwork from its form, style, texture, material, composition, and so forth in relation with the visual messages it tries to convey. Topics of interest include <i>Mourning Virgin from a Crucifixion Group</i> and <i>The Young Virgin</i>. I may also use some text as reference to illustrate my ideas when appropriate.
