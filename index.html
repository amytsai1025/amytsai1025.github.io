			<h1>Autobiography</h1>
			<p>
				My name is Amy Tsai. I was born and raised in Hsinchu City, Taiwan. I spent most of my childhood in the Siangshan District, where I attended a rural elementary school. There I developed some lifelong interests such as arts, music and writing.

				I was admitted into a gifted program at a local Catholic junior high school and later National Experimental High School. My talent in writing flourished during this period. I won several writing awards in the national and citywide contents, including the first place in Kuen Tai Cup and Union Cup Hsinchu. My research on the Image Museum of Hsinchu City also received an excellence award in the National Thesis Writing Contest. I attended New York Film Academy in summer 2014. With the generous scholarship offered by Educational Testing Service, my friends and I launched Filmmaking Camp for Teens in rural Hsinchu. In 2015, I traveled to New Zealand and UCLA for summer school. I was selected into the Taiwan Delegation to Israel in 2016 and was awarded the Harvard Prize Book the same year.

				I moved to New York City to attend Columbia University, which turned out to be a life-changing experience. Initially, I was planning to major in film. Thanks to the dynamic art scene of the City as well as Columbia’s activist communities, I became more interested in visual arts and social justice. Therefore, I ended up studying visual arts and sociology. Outside of school, I have worked extensively on film and theatre productions in design. My past experiences include Off-Broadway shows, immersive shows and commercials. I was the semi-Finalist of Nikon Storytellers Scholarship in North America and was selected in Boundless Exposed, a collaborative program for emerging theatre designers of color. During college, I also discovered a passion in Latin America and therefore traveled there several times.

				Due to COVID-19, I took a leave of absence from Columbia and am attending Wei Kong College at National Tsing Hua University in Taiwan. In addition to writing, I am also honing my art skills as well as working on a creative project that focuses on the female identity in film and performing arts.
