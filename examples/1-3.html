				Amy Tsai is a designer for film and theatre based in New York City and Taiwan. Her works have been selected by organizations like Athena Film Festival and Brooklyn Youth Arts Expo. Her design often features an interdisciplinary approach in various design and fine art areas. She believes that production design goes beyond location, period and style. It is about creating a world that carries literary meaning. Design is not just visuals, but a narrative itself.
